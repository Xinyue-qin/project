## AN EXTENSIVE EVALUATION OF PDDL CAPABILITIES IN OFF-THE-SHELF LLMS https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20175
 LLMs are capable of translating natural language descriptions into syntactically valid PDDL representations. However, there are gaps in between gold-standard models and gold-standard models. 
 This paper aims to figure out the underlying reasoning capabilities of LLMs and their potential role in executing complete planning tasks, i.e., explore the twenty LLMs from seven major families' 
 ability to parse, generate, and reason with PDDL
