Testing PDDL generated by LLMs (like Gemma, GPT, or Claude) requires a combination of **syntactic validation**, **semantic verification**, and **planning execution checks**. Here’s a step-by-step methodology:

---

### **1. Syntactic Validation (Basic Checks)**
**Goal**: Ensure the PDDL follows formal grammar rules.  
**Tools/Methods**:
- **Validator**: Use [`VAL`](https://github.com/KCL-Planning/VAL) (the standard PDDL validator):
  ```bash
  validate domain.pddl problem.pddl plan.txt
  ```
- **Online Parsers**: 
  - [PDDL4J](http://pddl4j.imag.fr/) (Java library)
  - [FastDownward](https://www.fast-downward.org/) (with `--translate-only` flag)

**Common LLM Errors**:
  - Missing parentheses or type declarations
  - Incorrect action/parameter syntax (e.g., `(action ?x - type)` vs `(action ?x -type)`)
  - Malformed preconditions/effects (e.g., using `AND` without parentheses)

---

### **2. Semantic Verification (Logical Consistency)**
**Goal**: Check if the PDDL *makes sense* for the task.  
**Approach**:
- **Manual Inspection**:
  - Do predicates match the domain’s requirements? (e.g., `(on ?x ?y)` should not accept `?y - robot` if only blocks can be stacked).
  - Do actions’ preconditions/effects align with real-world logic? (e.g., `(stack ?x ?y)` should require `(clear ?y)`).
- **Automated Checks**:
  - Generate small instances of the problem and validate expected invariants (e.g., "a block cannot be on two things at once").
  - Use theorem provers like [TLP](https://github.com/guillemdb/TLP) for formal verification.

**Example Test Case**:  
If the domain is about blocks, assert that `(on A B)` and `(on A C)` cannot both be true simultaneously.

---

### **3. Planning Execution (Functional Testing)**
**Goal**: Confirm the PDDL is solvable and produces correct plans.  
**Tools**:
- **Planners**:
  - [FastDownward](https://www.fast-downward.org/): Test with `--alias seq-opt-lmcut` for optimal planning.
  - [Pyperplan](https://github.com/aibasel/pyperplan): Lightweight for small problems.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Create simple problems (e.g., "stack block A on block B") and verify the planner generates the expected steps.
  - Edge cases: Empty initial state, conflicting goals, or unsolvable problems.

**Example**:
```pddl
; Problem file to test stack action
(:objects A B - block)
(:init (clear A) (clear B) (ontable A) (ontable B) (arm-empty))
(:goal (on A B))
```
**Expected Plan**: `(pick-up A) (stack A B)`

---

### **4. Comparative Benchmarking (vs Ground Truth)**
**Goal**: Evaluate LLM-generated PDDL against human-written PDDL.  
**Metrics**:
- **Correctness**: % of syntactically/semantically valid files.
- **Plan Quality**: Compare steps/time to solve with human-written PDDL.
- **Generalization**: Test on unseen problem instances.

**Datasets**:
- [IPC (International Planning Competition)](https://ipc2023.github.io/) benchmarks.
- [PDDL Gym](https://github.com/tomsilver/pddlgym) environments.

---

### **5. LLM-Specific Testing Strategies**
**Adversarial Testing**:
- **Prompt Engineering**:  
  - Ask the LLM to "explain" the generated PDDL in natural language to catch logical gaps.
  - Use chain-of-thought prompts (e.g., "First, define predicates for blocksworld...").
- **Iterative Refinement**:  
  - Feed validation errors back to the LLM for self-correction.

**Automated Pipeline**:
```python
# Pseudocode for automated testing
def test_llm_pddl(llm_output):
    if not validate_syntax(llm_output):
        return "Syntax Error"
    if not validate_semantics(llm_output):
        return "Semantic Error"
    plan = run_planner(llm_output)
    if not validate_plan(plan):
        return "Planning Failed"
    return "Success"
```

---

### **Common Pitfalls in LLM-Generated PDDL**
1. **Type Errors**: Mixing types (e.g., `(on ?x - block ?y - table)` but forgetting to declare `table` type).
2. **Overlooking Preconditions**: Missing critical constraints (e.g., allowing stacking without checking if the target is clear).
3. **Effect Overlaps**: Conflicting effects (e.g., `(not (holding ?x))` and `(holding ?y)` in the same action).

### **Example Test Suite for Blocksworld**
| Test Case               | Expected Result           | LLM Error Example                |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `(stack A A)`           | Invalid (self-stacking)   | Missing `(not (= ?x ?y))`         |
| `(stack A B)` when `B` is not clear | Plan failure       | Incorrect preconditions           |
| Unreachable goal        | No plan found             | LLM generates impossible PDDL     |

By combining these methods, you can systematically evaluate whether LLM-generated PDDL is correct and usable in practice. For rigorous testing, integrate this pipeline into CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions) for regression testing.
